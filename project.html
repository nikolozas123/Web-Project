<h3>Brief history</h3>
<p>Sky Finance was founded back in 2006 by a Man named Shun Akiyama. Akiyama was a former bank employee who was framed for stealing
    money from his company. The debt ridden man was left with no choice than to live in the streets, that is until the explosion of 
    millenium tower back in 2005, when money rained from the sky. Akiyama rushed to the scene scraping up all the green notes that he 
    could hold. While most people would spend their money on senseless entertainment for a brief moment of hapiness, our intelligent
    CEO decided to invest in stocks, a year later ,after some risky ordeals, he became owner of multiple successful companies. Thus 
    Shun Akiyama decided that everyone should have a second chance at life, no matter the past they had, thus he founded one of the 
    most proficient loan companies of Japan - Sky Finance aka "The lifeline of Kamarucho"

<h3>Why Sky Finance?</h3>

    but rather from how committed the client is to get their desired loan, measured by tests. 
    If one passes the test, they may get the desired cash loan without having to pay any interest or collateral.
